# Getting Started With Cognitive Services

Develop a mind-reading Twitter client with Azure Cognitive Services.

Adding machine learning, artificial intelligence and cognitive abilities to your Windows applications is easier than ever, thanks to Microsoft Azure services. Imagine a Twitter client that practically checks the userâ€™s state of mind before tweeting, potentially saving them an embarrassing tweet made in anger. With the Emotion and Text Analytics APIs from Azure Cognitive Services, not only is this possible, it's easy to do, analyzing both the text of a tweet and the user's facial expressions, before the send button is clicked.
